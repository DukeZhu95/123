('Bob Richardson', '95: Disco Elysium is a landmark title in gaming that will hopefully set a new standard for quality game design and writing. Everything offered within feels like a work borne from passion and talent, but that latter part’s what has me worried. I would love for Disco Elysium to somehow plant a flag that boldly proclaims, “Here! THIS is what we need to be doing and THIS is how you do it!” Even if a developer understands the “passion” part of the equation and puts in the time and resources, that doesn’t always mean they have a talent for this caliber of game. This review’s already gone on far too long, but I have to convey the affection I have for the central protagonist and his companion — their chemistry. Despite how much of a screw-up he is, I still love him for all his quirks and failings. And I made him that. Perhaps he’s a reflection of myself in some way since I have finally, for the first time ever, been given the true freedom to create the protagonist I want and not some flawless, altruistic knight who’s come to save the day.', '1112adb4b6af47238cbc563ae2b1c6ab'),

The Game is waiting, take your seat and experience it for yourself.', 'ef673112760b43c39b8492c31da80e4b'),

What elevates it even further is world building and music design that sews it up into a tight, cohesive experience.  A Monster\'s Expedition\'s quick hits of small puzzles passes all of those criteria with flying colors, and you owe it to yourself to give it a look.', '122ce57331224c4987bfa677682e9992'),
